  At SMLA, our students are comprised mostly of individuals in career transition, unemployed or underemployed professionals, so the end goal and focus are to help prepare them for placement within the job market. Students acquire and refine their transferable skills by gaining practical knowledge of industry trends, real-life scenarios, and case studies that are examples of the current challenges in the corporate environment.

An SMLA education will tell future employers exactly what skills and knowledge you have acquired, convincing them of the value you can bring to their company and giving you the edge for re-entry into the workforce.

If you are underemployed and want to update and verify your skills an SMLA education will maximize your transferable experience and amplify your strengths for career advancement.
